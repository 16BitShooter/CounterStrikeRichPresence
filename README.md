# CounterStrikeRichPresence
Installation and use is very simple. Some of you might get a windows defender pop up. If you do disable Real-Time Protection and continue.
Open the README and follow the instructions given. You should have no problems at all with VAC. If you do it's stringly recommended you do NOT continue using this. If CS:GO does not launch then create a short cut from steam and drag and drop it into the folder you extracted all the files to.
